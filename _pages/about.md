### 👋 Who I Am
I'm **Chenhaoyue (Iris) Wang**, a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science & Engineering at UCLA.  
My research bridges **quantum modeling**, **molecular dynamics**, and **energy materials design**.  
I focus on **flat-band physics**, **spin transport**, and **strain-induced transitions** in low-dimensional materials such as Kagome lattices and graphene analogs.

Previously, I worked on **graphene-shell lithium-ion batteries**, leading synthesis and electrochemical testing projects during my undergraduate years.

### 🌱 My Passions
- **Computation:** DFT (Quantum ESPRESSO, SPARC), MD (LAMMPS), tight-binding solvers in Python.  
- **Physics:** Spin conductivity, Berry phase polarization, topological transitions.  
- **Energy:** Interfacial ion transport, solid-state electrolytes.

### 🧗‍♀️ Beyond Research
I love exploring the outdoors—**bouldering**, **tennis**, **horse riding**, and **trail hiking**.  
Traveling inspires me to see science from new perspectives.

### 🎯 What I’m Looking For
I’m seeking opportunities in **computational materials**, **semiconductor R&D**, or **battery technology**, where I can blend simulation and experimentation to solve practical problems.
