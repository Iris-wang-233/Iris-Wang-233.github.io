Hello! I'm Chenhaoyue (Iris) Wang. 
Ph.D. candidate in MSE at UCLA (Prof. Banerjee). I work on computational materials for 2D/1D nanomaterial systems (Kagome, Lieb, graphene), **spin transport** (Rashba/Kaneâ€“Mele; Kubo/NEASS), and I previously worked on **Li-ion batteries** (EIS/CV, SEI, CVD).

### Interests
- DFT (Quantum ESPRESSO, SPARC), MD (LAMMPS), tight-binding solvers
- Time-resolved spin conductivity; Bloch oscillations
- Interfaces & ion transport in energy materials

### Target Roles
R&D in **computational materials** or **battery engineering**, bridging first-principles models to devices.
Hi, Iâ€™m **Chenhaoyue Wang**,  
Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science & Engineering at UCLA.  

My research combines **lithium-ion battery experiments** (cell assembly, CVD, EIS/CV testing) with  
**computational modeling** (DFT, MD, transport simulations).  

**Research areas:**
- Silicon Kagome lattices â€” phase transitions & reliability
- Flat-band materials â€” spin & charge transport
- Nanotubes & twisted 2D vdW systems
- Graphene shells for Li-ion anodes
