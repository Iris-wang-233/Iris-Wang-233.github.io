## Who I Am
I’m Chenhaoyue Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at UCLA, where I study the physics and mechanical properties of novel materials through theoretical models, first-principles calculations, and atomistic simulations.

During my graduate years, my research focuses on uncovering the relationship between low-dimensional material systems geometry design and their electronic properties, magnetism, mechanical stability, and transport, for both charge and spin, behaviors. I combine multiscale simulation methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) to study the thermal stability and strain-engineering effects of materials. Time-dependent tight-binding modeling and scattering matrix methods are used to study Bloch oscillations, spin conductivity, and charge current transport in strongly correlated electron systems.

Beyond quantum transport, I explore using machine-learning approaches to accelerate predictions of structural stability, electron localization, and magnetic behavior based on geometric design. These projects connect computational physics with data-driven materials discovery, speeding up the search and discovery of newly generated materials that may have special applications. This area excites me both scientifically and creatively.

Before UCLA, I earned my B.Eng. in New Energy Materials and Devices from Soochow University, where I worked on lithium-ion battery design, electrode fabrication, and electrochemical testing for over three years. These experiences continue to inform my interest in energy and solid-state interfaces throughout my research career.

## My Passions
- Computation: First-principles calculations (Density Functional Theory with Quantum ESPRESSO, SPARC); thermal dynamics, strain engineering, and phase transitions (AIMD with QE and MD with LAMMPS); theoretical models (tight-binding solvers and scattering matrix calculations in Python and MATLAB).  
- Physics: Charge transport, spin conductivity, Berry-phase polarization, and topological transitions.  
- Energy: Interfacial ion transport and solid-state electrolytes.

## Beyond Research
Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, tennis, and skiing, and I’m drawn to activities that challenge both body and mind. I stay active through running, bouldering, horse riding, and hiking, which help me maintain focus and energy in my work. I also love traveling and experiencing new cultures, as I find that exploring different environments continually broadens my perspective and creativity.

## What I’m Looking For
I’m interested in roles in computational materials, battery, and semiconductor research and development, where I can combine modeling and experimental expertise to design and optimize advanced materials for real-world applications.
