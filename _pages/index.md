Hi, I’m **Chenhaoyue (Iris) Wang**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science & Engineering at UCLA**.  
My research bridges **quantum theory, first-principles simulations, and data-driven modeling** to understand and design next-generation low-dimensional materials.

### 🧠 Research Focus
My Ph.D. work (4+ years) explores the **electronic, magnetic, polarization, thermal, and transport** properties of novel **2D and 1D materials** using **multi-scale computational methods**, including:

- **DFT / DFPT / AIMD / MD simulations** for structure, energetics, and dynamics  
- **Time-dependent Schrödinger equation and scattering-matrix models** for **electronic and spin transport**  
- **Python-based tight-binding modeling**, **spin current simulations**, and **Bloch oscillation analysis**  
- **Machine learning** to correlate **geometry** and **physical properties**, such as:  
  - SiKL buckling height vs. flat-band width  
  - Strain vs. phase transition temperature  
  - Doping/vacancy vs. magnetic behavior in 1D nanotubes

### 🔋 Experimental Background
Before my Ph.D., I spent over three years in a **battery research lab**, focusing on:

- **Anode composite optimization** and **electrode design**  
- **Electrochemical testing** (cycling, rate performance, EIS, CV)  
- **CVD growth** and **characterization** (SEM, TGA)

> *Li-ion batteries are a class of solid-state batteries when the electrolyte is solid rather than liquid.*

This experience gave me a hands-on understanding of how simulation insights connect directly to real device performance.

### 🌍 Research Vision
I’m passionate about connecting **atomic-scale simulations** with **real-world applications** — from **semiconductors and spintronic devices** to **batteries and next-generation materials** — bridging theory, computation, and experiment.
