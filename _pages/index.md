Hi, I'm **Chenhaoyue (Iris) Wang**, a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science & Engineering at UCLA.  
I study **computational materials**—from **DFT/MD simulations of 2D/1D systems** to **spin transport and flat-band physics**—and I also have hands-on **battery research** experience from my undergraduate years.

I'm passionate about connecting **atomic-scale insights** with **real-world devices**, whether through **R&D** in batteries, semiconductors, or next-generation materials.
