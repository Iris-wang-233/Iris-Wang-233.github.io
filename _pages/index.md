Hi, I’m **Chenhaoyue (Iris) Wang**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science & Engineering at UCLA**.  
My research bridges **quantum theory, first-principles simulations, and data-driven modeling** to understand and design next-generation low-dimensional materials.

## Research Focus
My Ph.D. work (4+ years) explores the electronic, magnetic, polarization, thermal, and transport properties of novel 2D and 1D materials using multi-scale computational methods, including:

- DFT / DFPT / AIMD / MD simulations for structure, energetics, and dynamics  
- Time-dependent Schrödinger equation and scattering-matrix models for electronic and spin transport  
- Python-based tight-binding modeling, spin current simulations, and Bloch oscillation analysis  
- Machine learning to correlate geometry and physical properties, such as:  
  - SiKL buckling height vs. electron wavefunction localization  
  - Strain vs. 1st phase transition temperature  
  - Doping/vacancy site vs. magnetic behavior in 1D nanotubes

## Experimental Background
Before my Ph.D., I spent over three years in the battery research lab, focusing on:
- Anode composite optimization and electrode design
- Cell assembly and glove box operation
- Battery electrochemical testing (cycling, rate performance, EIS, CV)  
- CVD growth and sample characterization (SEM, TGA)

This experience gave me a solid background of manufactring and how lab data testing connect directly to real device performance.

## Research Vision
I’m passionate about connecting atomic-scale simulations and quantum physics models with real-world applications and devices, especially for semiconductors and spintronic devices to*batteries and next-generation new energy material, bridging theoretic models, computations, and experiments.
