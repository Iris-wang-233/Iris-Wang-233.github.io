# Welcome!

Hi, I’m **Chenhaoyue (Iris) Wang**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science & Engineering at UCLA**.  
My research bridges **quantum theory, first-principles simulations, and data-driven modeling** to understand and design next-generation low-dimensional materials.

### Research Focus

My Ph.D. work (4+ years) explores the **electronic, magnetic, polarization, thermal, and transport** properties of novel **2D and 1D materials** using **multi-scale computational methods** such as:

- **DFT / DFPT / AIMD / MD simulations** for structural, energetic, and dynamic properties.  
- **Time-dependent Schrödinger equation and scattering-matrix models** to study **electronic and spin transport**.  
- **Python-based tight-binding modeling**, **spin current simulations**, and **Bloch oscillation analysis** (automated code + physical modeling).  
- **Machine learning** frameworks to link **geometry and physical behavior**, e.g.:  
  - predicting SiKL buckling height vs. flat-band width,  
  - strain vs. phase transition temperature,  
  - doping/vacancy vs. magnetic properties in 1D nanotubes.

### Experimental Background

Before my Ph.D., I spent 3+ years in a **battery research lab**, focusing on:
- **Anode composite optimization** and **electrode design**,  
- **Electrochemical testing** (cycling, rate, EIS, CV),  
- **Sample synthesis** (CVD growth), and  
- **Characterization** (SEM, TGA).

This experience gave me a hands-on understanding of how simulation insights can connect directly to real device performance.

> ⚡ *Li-ion batteries are indeed a class of solid-state batteries when their electrolyte is solid rather than liquid.*

### Research Vision

I’m passionate about connecting **atomic-scale insights** with **real-world applications** — from **semiconductors and spintronic devices** to **batteries and energy materials** — bridging theory, computation, and experiment.
