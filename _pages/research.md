### Silicon Kagome Lattices (UCLA, 2022–2025)
- DFT (QE/SPARC) for stability & band structure; phonon calculations via perturbation & finite displacement.  
- Large-scale MD/AIMD revealed **strain-induced crystal–amorphous transitions**.  
- Identified ~**2% critical strain** affecting thermal/mechanical reliability.  

### Transport in Flat-Band Materials (UCLA, 2023– )
- Built tight-binding + time-dependent models (Python/MATLAB).  
- Simulated **charge & spin transport** in graphene, Kagome, Lieb lattices under external fields.  
- Explored **strain engineering effects** on conductivity.  

### Nanotubes & Twisted van der Waals Materials (UCLA, 2022–2024)
- Applied **helical-symmetry AIMD (M-SPARC)** to P₂C₃ nanotubes of various chirality.  
- Studied vacancy/H-doping effects on magnetism; modeled twisted bilayer hBN/graphene → polarization & GSFE.  

### Li-ion Graphene Shells (Soochow, 2016–2019)
- CVD-grown graphene shells as Li-ion anodes.  
- Improved performance: **+25% capacity at 10C**, **>90% retention after 500 cycles**.  
- Characterized via SEM, Raman, TGA, CV, EIS.
