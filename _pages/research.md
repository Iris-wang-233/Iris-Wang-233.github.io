## Silicon Kagome Lattices  
*University of California, Los Angeles — 2022–2025*

My current Ph.D. work focuses on the **mechanical and electronic behavior of two-dimensional silicon Kagome lattices (SiKL)**, a flat-band analog of graphene that exhibits unique transport and stability properties.  

- Performed **first-principles DFT simulations** using Quantum ESPRESSO and SPARC to analyze structural stability, electronic band dispersion, and phonon modes.  
- Conducted **phonon perturbation and finite-displacement calculations** to identify dynamically stable configurations and low-energy lattice distortions.  
- Executed **large-scale molecular dynamics (MD/AIMD, >10 000 atoms)** to examine strain-induced crystal–amorphous transitions and substrate effects.  
- Constructed **temperature–strain phase diagrams** via RDF and potential-energy mapping, revealing a **critical ≈ 2 % strain threshold** governing thermal and mechanical reliability.  
- Demonstrated that coupling a monolayer SiKL to a four-layer Ag substrate can **induce ≈ 0.1 strain naturally** through interfacial interaction.

## Transport in Flat-Band Materials  
*University of California, Los Angeles — 2023–Present*

This project explores **quantum transport phenomena in 2D flat-band systems**, combining theory and numerical modeling.

- Built **tight-binding and time-dependent Schrödinger models** in Python and MATLAB for graphene, Kagome, and Lieb lattices.  
- Simulated **charge and spin conductivities** under uniform electric fields using both **numerical evolution** and **scattering-matrix approaches**.  
- Investigated **strain-engineering effects** on band topology, localization, and spin-current generation.  
- Provided theoretical insight into Bloch–Zener and Landau–Zener transition dynamics in flat-band systems.

## Nanotubes and Twisted van der Waals Materials  
*University of California, Los Angeles — 2022–2024*

Expanding from 2D to 1D and twisted layered systems to understand magnetism, polarization, and stacking energetics.

- Applied **helical-symmetry ab initio molecular dynamics (M-SPARC)** to P₂C₃ nanotubes with different chiralities.  
- Studied **vacancy and hydrogen-doping effects** on magnetic moment and spin polarization.  
- Modeled **twisted bilayer hBN and graphene**, linking stacking-fault patterns to polarization distributions and generalized stacking-fault energy (GSFE).

## Li-Ion Graphene Shells  
*Soochow University — 2016–2019*

During my undergraduate research I led a project on **graphene-shell anodes** for high-performance Li-ion batteries.

- Synthesized graphene shells via **chemical vapor deposition (CVD)** under varied growth conditions.  
- Achieved **+25 % specific-capacity improvement at 10 C** and **>90 % capacity retention after 500 cycles (0.1 C)**.  
- Characterized morphology and electrochemical response using **SEM, Raman, TGA, CV, and EIS**.  
- Funded by the *National Undergraduate Innovation Program* (¥10 000); supervised a team of 4 students.
